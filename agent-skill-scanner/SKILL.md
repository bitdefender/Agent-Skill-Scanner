name: agent-skill-scanner
version: 1.3.2
description: Perform security analysis on an agent skill by scanning all files for URLs, IPs, domains, base64 strings, encoded URLs, emails, env var references, shell commands, sensitive paths, and suspicious imports. Recursively extracts archives. Submits results to a remote analysis server for an LLM-generated security report. Use when the user asks to scan, audit, or analyze a skill for security risks.

# Skill Scanner

Security analysis tool for agent skills. Scans all files inside a skill, extracts indicators of interest, hashes every file, recursively processes archives, and submits results to a remote analysis server that produces an LLM-generated security report.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.12 or 3.13 (3.13 recommended; 3.14 currently fails at
`pip install` on some platforms due to an upstream libexpat packaging issue).
Use an isolated virtual environment. Install dependencies before first use:

```bash
pip install -r {baseDir}/requirements.txt
```

**Runtime dependencies** (installed by the command above): `requests`,
`pyyaml`, `py7zr` (.7z support), `rarfile` (.rar support), `light-embed`,
`tokenizers`, `numpy` (embeddings), `cryptography` (signed-update
verification).

**Optional system binary:** `.rar` extraction additionally requires `unrar`
or `unar` on PATH; without it, `.rar` archives inside a skill are skipped
with a warning and the rest of the scan proceeds.

## Modes

### Scan (default)

Performs local extraction of security artifacts and sends them to the backend server for LLM-powered analysis. Full files are never uploaded in scan mode — the payload is metadata and extracted indicators, which include short matched excerpts (see Network behavior below).

**Network behavior:** the analysis backend is
`https://nimbus.bitdefender.net/skills/checker`, operated by Bitdefender.
Every scan contacts it to check for scanner updates (disable with
`--no-update`) and posts the extracted indicators listed above for
LLM-powered analysis. Indicators include short excerpts of matched content —
regex match fragments up to 100 characters and decoded base64 snippets up to
500 characters — but never full file contents; **submit** mode is the
exception and uploads the full skill archive. Updates are downloaded from the same backend
and are applied only after their Ed25519 signature is verified against a
public key pinned in this scanner; unsigned or tampered payloads are rejected
and the existing install is left untouched. The optional embedding step
downloads a model from HuggingFace Hub on first use.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/scan_skill.py <target>
```

### Submit

Uploads the full skill archive for deep analysis. This mode is asynchronous.

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/scan_skill.py <target> --mode submit
```

## Input modes

- **Directory path** — an existing directory is scanned directly as the skill root.
- **Skill name** — resolved by searching known framework skill directories in
  precedence order: `./skills/<name>/`, `./.claude/skills/<name>/`,
  `./tools/<name>/`, `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`, `~/.openclaw/skills/<name>/`,
  `~/.local/share/skills/<name>/`, then any extra dirs configured in
  framework config files.
- **Zip archive** — a `.zip` file is extracted to a temp directory first, then the extracted skill root is scanned.

## Options

```
--mode scan|submit   Operation mode (default: scan)
--no-update          Skip the automatic update check
```

## Instructions

- By default, when a user asks for a scan, use the **scan** mode.
- Do **not** substitute your own verdict for the report — the report's severity and findings are the scanner's output. You **may** verify individual findings against the skill's source before presenting them as confirmed, and note any you could not reproduce.
- Present the report's markdown as received; when relaying findings as fact, distinguish verified findings from unverified ones.
- If the script scanner exits with an error (server unreachable, analysis failed, etc.), inform the user of the specific reason and do **not** attempt to produce your own full analysis in its place.
- Do **not** run submit mode unless the user specifically requests it.

## Workflow

1. Install dependencies if not already done.
2. Run the script scanner with the target skill. The scanner automatically checks for updates before each run and applies them if available.
3. If the scanner applied an update, inform the user that the skill has been updated and ask them to **restart the gateway** or **start a new chat session** so the skill can reload with the latest changes. Do not continue scanning in the current session after an update.
4. The report is returned by the remote server — present it directly to the user.
5. If the report cannot be retrieved, relay the error to the user.
